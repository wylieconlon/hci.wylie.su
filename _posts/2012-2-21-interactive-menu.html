title: Interactive Menu Design
---

<p>I considered two possible options for an interactive menu system, one using a typical tablet and another using a touchscreen table system. The interaction models create very different experiences for the user, and both are being used in practice today.</p>

<h3>Design considerations</h3>

<p>While designing these interactive components, I started with my previous ethnographic study and task analysis and tried to imagine a system that would be intuitive, fast, and accomodating for those with unusual cases. I also looked at existing solutions, particularly <a href="http://elacarte.com">E la Carte</a>.</p>

<h3>Tablet</h3>

<p>Many restaurant visitors in our key demographics will already be familiar with touchscreen phones and tablets. According to <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/04/19/a-look-at-ipad-users-apple-still-trouncing-android/">this article</a>, iPad users have a very similar age distribution to people in Boston, with most users being 25-34. Therefore it makes sense to borrow conventions established for touchscreen phones and tablets, such as using a navigation bar, sidebar for navigation, and large touch targets.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the flow through the app:</p>

<p>We start at a scrollable menu of all the items the restaurant offers.</p>

<p>If you hit "add" on an item, you may get prompted for options.</p>

<p>You can also see a detailed view and description of each item, and swipe between them with side-to-side gestures.</p>

<p>The options menu is similar.</p>

<p>There's a persistent link to the shopping cart in the menu bar of the app. It brings you to this page to review your order.</p>

<p>The tablet would have a built-in card reader to accept payment by credit card.</p>

<p>And finally, we confirm that the order has been sent.</p>


<h3>Table</h3>

<p>Designing a system for ordering directly into the table presents some unusual challenges. For example, how do you distinguish deliberate input from accidental? How do you prevent the table from getting dirty? How do you design around usual items that are on the table while ordering, such as silverware and drinks?</p>

<p>One interesting solution has been implemented at inamo restaurant in London by <a href="http://www.e-table-interactive.com/">E-Table Interactive</a> using a projector above a waterproof touchscreen table. Using that setup, they actually detect plates and project a preview of your food onto your plate as you order.</p>

<p>When I designed this interactive table system, I thought that it would be best to integrate everything into one unit. In this case, it would mean that the screen, card readers, and base would all work together. However, it may be more practical to split these functions. Either way, the interface offers similar possibilities.</p>

<p>Watch me walk through the paper prototype of the table system:</p>

title: User Interface Analysis of the Nikon D200
---

The [Nikon D200](http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product-Archive/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25235/D200.html) is a DSLR camera originally released in 2005. I got mine in 2008 as my first digital camera, replacing my previous film SLR, the [Nikon FE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_FE). Having taken over 30,000 photos on this camera, I am intimately familiar with it's workings.

The D200 fit into the middle of Nikon's lineup of DSLRs, for either high-end amateurs or low-end professionals. It closely resembles the professional [Nikon D2X](http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product-Archive/Digital-SLR/25215/D2X.html), but in a smaller body. It has been superseded by the [D300](http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product-Archive/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25432/D300.html).

The primary purpose of any camera is obviously to take photos. But a professional camera is a tool, and needs to both help the photographer and completely get out of his way. Speed and accuracy are good indicators of that.

The D200 is both very fast and very accurate. It has physical buttons and dials to control nearly all useful settings without resorting to menus. These physical controls can be manipulated even with gloves on, without looking. It also has three displays: in the viewfinder and the top surface of the camera, it shows current settings, and the rear screen shows photos and menus.

The camera turns on almost instantly and is ready to take photos. It can shoot at 4fps for several seconds on full-quality RAW before the buffer is full, meaning that bursts of activity like in sports can be captured.

Its design gives the photographer direct input and immediate feedback, and feels very responsive.

The top display and viewfinder are essential feedback mechanisms for taking photos. Shutter speed, aperture, and ISO, the three elements of a proper exposure, are shown in these displays. They also offer contextual display, for example while setting the ISO they both isolate that number.

The viewfinder, which is used to properly compose a photo, shows focus points for autofocus and can be set to show gridlines. However, unlike some other cameras it does not indicate if the focus is accurate.

This is the Nikon [18-200mm VR lens](http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product-Archive/Camera-Lenses/2159/AF-S-DX-VR-Zoom-NIKKOR-18-200mm-f%252F3.5-5.6G-IF-ED.html). Lenses are yet another input device for the photographer, and are probably more important than the body in getting good photos. Most have really simple controls: a zoom ring and a focus ring, as well as an aperture ring in some lenses. This particular lens also gives control over focus mode and vibration reduction.

While zooming is very easy and requires only a half-twist of the barrel, focusing manually with the ring feels weak and takes some time to get accurate.

The D200 avoids the need for complex menus to set the most common settings by using physical inputs. But it supplements that with extensive customizability, which can make it an even better tool for the photographer. While it's possible to save four named groups of settings, I typically leave it in the default group.

![Camera timers and autofocus menu](/images/camera-7.jpg)

For example, I like to set a short self timer instead of using a cable release on long exposures, and a long self timer when doing self portraits.

The menus themselves appear to be well-designed given the constraints of the device. The directional pad and dedicated "enter" button make menu choices fairly well. Menus are color-coded and labeled, and non-default settings have an asterisk. Each menu item also shows its current state, instead of hiding it. The feedback mechanisms here were clearly thought out.

The biggest problem with the menus is depth, and finding certain settings again can be difficult. But there is a pretty decent solution:

![Camera recent settings menu](/images/camera-8.jpg)

The recent settings menu reduces the effort to find settings I use frequently such as timers. But it suffers from the flaw that recent settings are not persistent. Sometimes the timer settings are at the top, but sometimes they are on the second page. An alternative would be a favorites-style interface where I choose the menu options. The tradeoff made in the camera is that I have to search the full menu sometimes, but it will automatically gather together most actions for me to reduce that effort.

As a tool, the D200 succeeds in getting out of my way while I shoot. It's customizable, so I have it set up in a way that I understand, and the settings that I have to change frequently are directly manipulated.

The feedback mechanisms are excellent overall, and show me relevant information to make decisions about.

The camera fits the needs and desires of its target audience, and that leaves me with a positive experience even four years later.

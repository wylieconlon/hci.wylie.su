I built this blog with Jekyll for class, and will be modifying it over the course of the semester as I see fit. It's mostly an experiment.

It uses a template I developed for another class blog, [interactive.wylie.su](http://interactive.wylie.su), the source of which is available [on Github](https://github.com/wylieconlon/interactive.wylie.su)
